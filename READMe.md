# TET Andalusia – Summer Restrictions

This project provides an interactive web map visualizing the legal and illegal sections of the Trans Euro Trail (TET) in Andalusia during the summer fire restriction period, according to the wildfire regulations issued by the Junta de Andalucía.

## 🔍 What It Does

- **Highlights TET sections** that are **illegal to ride in summer** due to their location within forest areas or their 400 m buffer zones.
- Uses **official road network data** to verify whether tracks are within 50 m of legal roads (as required by law).
- Shows **legal sections** in blue and **illegal sections** in red.
- Includes additional map layers: towns, water, forest, and road buffers.
