# TET Andalusia ‚Äì Summer Restrictions

This project provides an interactive web map visualizing the legal and illegal sections of the Trans Euro Trail (TET) in Andalusia during the summer fire restriction period, according to the wildfire regulations issued by the Junta de Andaluc√≠a.

## üîç What It Does

- **Highlights TET sections** that are **illegal to ride in summer** due to their location within forest areas or their 400‚ÄØm buffer zones.
- Uses **official road network data** to verify whether tracks are on legal roads (as required by law).
- Shows the **TET track** in blue and **illegal sections** in red.
- Includes additional map layers: towns, water, forest, and forest buffers.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to GPS inaccuracies and data resolution, a 50‚ÄØm tolerance was used to determine proximity to official roads.

> üóÇÔ∏è The forest and road layers were simplified for better map performance ‚Äì all legality calculations were done using the full-resolution geometries.
